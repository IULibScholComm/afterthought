## Notes to Slaback Family 

I have no idea who originally took these family photographs. Some of them came from my mother's sister, June. Others I inherited when my mother passed away.

I developed this chart using [Ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com/) and census records. Only people who were alive during Lilaâ€™s lifetime are listed; younger children and later generations are not. The fathers of Lila's last four children are speculative but are included as a reference for readers.

The first section of this book, "The Slaback Family," is told from Lila's perspective using words and observations that a child (and later, a teenager) would make. As one of the younger children in a large family, she would not have received much attention from her parents. I imagine that her oldest sister, Izro, was more like a mother to her.
