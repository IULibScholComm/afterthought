Only people who were alive during Lila's lifetime are listed; younger children and later generations are not. The fathers of Lila's last four children are speculative but are included as a reference for readers.](images/Akou03.jpg){fig-alt="Genealogical chart that shows the connections between Lila and her parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews, and children." width="80%" fig-scap="Members of the Slaback Family 1922--1958"} 

## Notes

I have no idea who originally took these family photographs. Some of them came from my mother's sister, June. Others I inherited when my mother passed away.  

The first section of this book, "The Slaback Family," is told from Lila's perspective using words and observations that a child (and later, a teenager) would make. As one of the younger children in a large family, she would not have received much attention from her parents. I imagine that her oldest sister, Izro, was more like a mother to her.
